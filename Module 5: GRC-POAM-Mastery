#  Module 5: Hands-On POA&M Demonstrations  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

##  Module Purpose

You’ve learned the what, when, and why — now it’s time to **lead by doing**.

This module is where your GRC leadership becomes operational. You’ll walk through hands-on POA&M development using realistic vulnerability data and industry-grade tools.

>  *The best leaders don’t just assign tasks — they can build the thing themselves.*

---

## 🔧 What You’ll Demonstrate

1. Review scan findings (mock ACAS/WSUS report)
2. Identify a security weakness
3. Populate a POA&M entry using the provided template
4. Assign milestones, ownership, and evidence requirements
5. Prepare for closure and audit-readiness

##  Files to Use

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 📄 [Mock WSUS ACAS SCAN.xlsx](./Mock%20WSUS%20ACAS%20SCAN.xlsx) | Source vulnerability data |
| 📄 [Blank POA&M Template.xlsm](./Blank%20POA&M%20Template.xlsm) | Structured POA&M with macros and fields |

Download and open both files. Practice converting a raw vulnerability finding into a complete POA&M record.

## 🛠 Execution Tip

**Use the POA&M template’s built-in macros or filters to:**
- Track by severity
- Sort by due date
- Prioritize criticals
- Auto-flag overdue items

---

##  Leadership-Level Enhancements

- Build a dashboard (Excel, Power BI, etc.) from your POA&M data
- Track KPIs: % closed, avg. days open, aging findings
- Share monthly status with stakeholders or risk councils

> 📈 That’s how GRC leaders communicate risk maturity.

---

##  Reflection Prompt

>  *Can you confidently convert scan data into a defensible, auditor-ready POA&M?*

If yes, you’re ready to lead teams and programs. If not — this module is your proving ground.

---

## 🏁 Summary

- Hands-on POA&M building is a core GRC skill
- Mastering this process turns you from analyst to advisor
- Practice using the templates and build your real-world muscle
