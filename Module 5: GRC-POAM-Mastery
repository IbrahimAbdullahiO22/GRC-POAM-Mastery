#  Module 5: Hands-On POA&M Demonstrations  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

## 🎯 Module Purpose

This module represents my hands-on effort to practice POA&M execution using realistic tools and data. While I haven’t yet done this in a professional job, I’ve created a structured workflow to simulate how POA&Ms are built, tracked, and closed using actual scan data formats and NIST-aligned templates.

>  *This is where I move from theory to practice — simulating how POA&Ms are handled in the field.*

---

##  What I Practiced

- Analyzing mock vulnerability scan results  
- Identifying risks that require a POA&M  
- Populating a POA&M using the official field structure  
- Assigning mock milestones and due dates  
- Practicing how to document closure evidence

## 🧾 Sample Scenario I Simulated

**Finding:** CVE-2023-XXXX on Windows Server  
**Source:** Mock WSUS Vulnerability Scan  
**Risk:** Critical  
**System Impacted:** WIN-DC-02

**POA&M Entry Practice:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Weakness ID | WSUS-CVE-2023-001 |
| Description | Remote code execution vulnerability |
| Source | Mock WSUS scan |
| Scheduled Completion Date | 2024-09-01 |
| Milestones | 1. Patch applied by 08/20, 2. Validation by 08/25 |
| Status | In Progress |
| Evidence | Placeholder for scan screenshot or remediation ticket |

This exercise helped me understand the workflow that analysts, ISSOs, and auditors follow when tracking unresolved findings.

## 📁 Practice Files I Used

- 📄 [Blank POA&M Template.xlsm](./Blank%20POA&M%20Template.xlsm)  
- 📄 [Mock WSUS ACAS SCAN.xlsx](./Mock%20WSUS%20ACAS%20SCAN.xlsx)

These templates allowed me to practice POA&M completion, milestone tracking, and status updates — just like a real GRC analyst would.

---

##  Reflection Prompt

> ✅ *Could I take a finding from a scan and convert it into a POA&M that someone else could pick up and act on — without asking me questions?*

That’s the goal of this module: clarity, structure, and accountability.

---

## 🏁 Summary

- I practiced building POA&Ms from mock scan data  
- I used NIST-based templates to simulate ownership, remediation, and closure  
- This hands-on work helps prepare me for real GRC, compliance, or security analyst roles
