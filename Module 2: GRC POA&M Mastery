#  Module 2: POA&M Essentials  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

##  Module Purpose

This module focuses on understanding and practicing the **core structure of a POA&M**. As someone actively learning Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), I’ve studied how POA&Ms are used to document control gaps and track remediation efforts in frameworks like **NIST RMF**, **FedRAMP**, and **FISMA**.

> ✅ *I created this module to build my own hands-on knowledge of POA&M execution.*

## 📋 Key POA&M Fields I’ve Studied and Practiced

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Weakness ID** | Unique name or number for tracking |
| **Description of Weakness** | Clear summary of the security or compliance issue |
| **Source Identified** | Where the issue came from (e.g., scan, audit) |
| **Impact** | Why it matters to the system or organization |
| **Scheduled Completion Date** | Target remediation date |
| **Milestones** | Step-by-step plan with specific dates |
| **Resources Required** | People, tools, or approvals needed |
| **Status** | Open, In Progress, Delayed, or Closed |
| **Justification for Delay** | Reason for delays (if applicable) |
| **Evidence** | Documents, screenshots, or scan data to show closure

##  My Learning Experience

Through self-directed training, I explored how POA&Ms are used to manage and track remediation across security programs. I reviewed federal guidance (like NIST SP 800-53, control CA-5) and practiced writing my own POA&M entries using sample scan data.

I created this module to:
- Reinforce what I’ve learned about POA&M structure  
- Build confidence using tools like Excel to simulate real-world tracking  
- Prepare for future roles in GRC, cybersecurity, and compliance

## 📎 Practice Files

- 📄 [Blank POA&M Template.xlsm](../../module5_hands_on/Blank%20POA&M%20Template.xlsm)  
- 📄 [Mock WSUS ACAS SCAN.xlsx](../../module5_hands_on/Mock%20WSUS%20ACAS%20SCAN.xlsx)

These templates and datasets helped me practice translating raw vulnerability data into structured POA&M records.

##  Reflection Prompt

>  *Would your POA&M entry make sense to someone reading it during an audit — even if you weren’t there to explain it?*

That’s the level of clarity I aim for in every practice entry.

## 🏁 Summary

- I created this module to build hands-on understanding of POA&M structure and purpose  
- I’ve used public guidance and practice files to simulate real POA&M work  
- This is part of my personal learning path as I prepare for a GRC or cybersecurity role
