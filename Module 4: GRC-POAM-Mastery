# 🚨 Module 4: Trigger Points – When a POA&M Is Required  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

##  Module Purpose

Leadership in risk management begins with **awareness** — knowing not just how to document risk, but **when** to raise the flag.

This module teaches you how to recognize the **exact moments** when a POA&M must be opened. Miss the trigger, and you miss the chance to control risk.

> ✅ *Strong GRC leaders don’t wait for audits to act — they anticipate, document, and lead from the front.*

##  What Triggers a POA&M?

A POA&M is required anytime there is a **recognized deficiency** in a security control or an **unremediated risk**.

### 🔍 Common Trigger Points

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
|  Vulnerability Scan (ACAS/Nessus) | Critical CVEs discovered |
|  Security Assessment or Audit | Control CA-7 marked “partially implemented” |
|  Incident or Breach | Post-incident review uncovers gaps |
|  Pen Test / Red Team Exercise | Exploitable misconfigurations |
|  Change Implementation | New system lacks full security control |
|  Delayed Implementation | Control requirement missed go-live |
|  Continuous Monitoring | Endpoint AVs outdated or signature gaps detected |

##  NIST & FedRAMP Requirements

> Per **NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5)** – Control **CA-5**,  
> > “Organizations shall develop a POA&M when a security or privacy control is assessed as not satisfied.”

FedRAMP enforces this even further — requiring monthly POA&M updates and tracking down to the milestone level.

##  Leadership Mindset

> *“Compliance is not just about passing the test — it's about catching the problem before the test begins.”*

Build a culture where:
- Teams self-report risks early
- GRC proactively opens POA&Ms
- Transparency is seen as maturity — not failure

##  Reflection Prompt

> ✅ *What’s more dangerous — the risk you acknowledge or the one you miss because you never opened a POA&M?*

---

## 🏁 Summary

- POA&Ms must be triggered by any documented control gap
- Knowing when to open a POA&M is a core compliance leadership skill
- A mature security program documents **early**, not late
