#  Module 1: Introduction & Foundation  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

##  Module Purpose

Welcome to **Module 1**, where I lay the groundwork for how I’ve used POA&Ms in real-world cybersecurity operations. This content is based on my personal experience working with vulnerability findings, risk tracking, and compliance frameworks in enterprise environments.

>  *I’ve used POA&Ms in the field — not just as a document, but as a driver of audit readiness, accountability, and trust.*

##  What is a POA&M?

A **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** is a structured record that:
- Identifies security control weaknesses or gaps  
- Outlines remediation steps and due dates  
- Assigns ownership and accountability  
- Tracks milestones, delays, and final closure  
- Provides evidence for auditors and assessors  

---

## 📌 How I’ve Used POA&Ms in Practice

- Documented control gaps found through **ACAS** and **WSUS** vulnerability scans  
- Entered POA&Ms for findings during RMF security assessments  
- Assigned remediation tasks to system teams and tracked deadlines  
- Managed closure and ensured evidence (e.g., screenshots, scan results) was audit-ready  
- Supported FedRAMP and internal audit cycles by ensuring POA&Ms were complete, clear, and compliant

##  NIST Framework Alignment

| NIST Document | Relevance |
|---------------|-----------|
| **SP 800-53 (CA-5)** | Control requiring POA&M creation for deficiencies |
| **SP 800-37 (RMF)** | Shows where POA&Ms are used in the security lifecycle |
| **SP 800-137** | Ties POA&Ms to continuous monitoring efforts |
| **SP 800-171** | Requires POA&Ms when CUI controls can’t be immediately enforced |

##  My Experience Using POA&Ms

> This content reflects what I’ve actually done in cybersecurity compliance work.

I’ve filled out real POA&Ms tied to vulnerability scans, worked with system owners to clarify findings, created milestones for patching timelines, and ensured all documentation was in place for control CA-5 review. I’ve also helped teach these practices to junior analysts and supported audit teams with POA&M evidence.

This isn’t theory. This is what I’ve done — and what I now share to help others lead with clarity and accountability.

##  Leadership Prompt

>  *Do you treat POA&Ms as paperwork — or as proof that your security program is working?*

---

## 🏁 Summary

- POA&Ms track the story of risk, responsibility, and resolution  
- I’ve used them to pass audits, close findings, and support RMF workflows  
- Through this module, I show what real-world POA&M leadership looks like
