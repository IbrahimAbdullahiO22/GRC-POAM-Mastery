# 📅 Day 42 – Registering OpenMRS in Our System Inventory

## ✅ From Invisible to Accountable: Putting OpenMRS on the Map

A few years back, while helping support backend systems at a university, I stumbled on a forgotten server still in use—but undocumented, unpatched, and unsecured. That moment changed how I understood system governance. If it's not officially tracked, it's not officially protected.

So today, leading the GRC design for our healthcare system built on OpenMRS, I’m ensuring we **don’t repeat that mistake**.

Day 42 marks the final task of the NIST RMF *Prepare* phase:  
👉 **System Registration** — the act of officially recording OpenMRS into our organization’s system inventory.

This might sound like bureaucracy, but it’s a **foundational control** that separates shadow IT from managed infrastructure. In security, **you can’t protect what you don’t know exists**.

## 🗂️ Why Register Systems?

System registration serves several critical functions:

-  **Visibility** – So IT, security, and leadership know what’s in the environment  
-  **Accountability** – Assigns an owner to every system  
-  **Compliance** – Required by frameworks like FISMA, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.  
-  **Audit Readiness** – Ensures traceability of data flows and system functions  
-  **Security Monitoring** – Makes sure systems get scanned, logged, and patched  
-  **Operational Planning** – Helps prioritize resources and roadmap updates

## 🏥 OpenMRS System Registration Snapshot

Here’s a conceptual registration record for our OpenMRS deployment:

| **Field**                    | **Details** |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **System Name**             | MyClinic OpenMRS EHR System |
| **System Owner**            | Dr. Alice Smith, Health IT Manager |
| **Description**             | Cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform deployed on AWS, supporting patient data management |
| **Hosting Environment**     | AWS (us-west-2), EC2 instances within VPC `vpc-0abc123`, RDS for backend |
| **Authorization Boundary**  | Includes OpenMRS app, Amazon EC2, RDS, S3 (backup), CloudWatch monitoring |
| **Data Sensitivity**        | Protected Health Information (PHI) – HIPAA regulated |
| **Impact Level**            | Moderate-High (based on CIA triad: Confidentiality & Availability are critical) |
| **Compliance Requirements**| HIPAA, NIST 800-53 Moderate baseline |
| **Connections**             | Interfaces with billing system, reporting dashboard, and authentication services |
| **Registration Date**       | June 3, 2025 |
| **Contacts**                | Owner: Dr. Alice Smith, Custodian: I. Abdullahi (GRC Analyst), ISSO: TBA |

## 💬 Leadership Insight

In leadership, our job isn’t just to ship code or maintain systems — it’s to build **clarity and structure** around technology. This is where GRC comes in.

Registering OpenMRS isn’t just about compliance; it’s about **ensuring no system falls through the cracks**. It’s how we turn an application from “a cool healthcare tool someone built” into an **official, protected, governed information asset**.

When I think of system registration, I think:  
**“Would a new hire know what this system does, where it runs, who owns it, and how secure it is?”**  
If not, registration isn’t complete.

## ✍️ Hands-On Practice

Try it yourself. Here’s a simple structure to fill out for any system:

- **System Name**  
- **Owner (Name + Title)**  
- **Description/Purpose**  
- **Data Sensitivity Level (e.g., PHI, PII, internal)**  
- **Hosting Environment (AWS, Azure, on-prem, etc.)**  
- **Compliance Drivers (HIPAA, FISMA, PCI, etc.)**  
- **Connections to Other Systems**  
- **Registration Date & Responsible Contacts**

Even doing this for a fictional system builds the muscle of governance.

## 🧠 Reflection

A well-maintained system inventory is **the backbone of risk management**. When systems are known and documented:

- Incident response is faster  
- Personnel transitions are smoother  
- Audits are cleaner  
- Risks are easier to identify and resolve

When systems are undocumented?  
That’s when breaches go unnoticed, and blame goes nowhere.

## 🔮 Tomorrow’s Mission

🎉 We’ve officially closed out the RMF Prepare phase!  
Up next: **Categorization** – where we analyze the potential impact of compromise on our system’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For healthcare systems like OpenMRS, that step carries serious weight.

Let’s keep building toward a more secure, compliant, and resilient system.  
See you on **Day 43**.
