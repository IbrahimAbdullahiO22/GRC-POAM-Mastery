##  6 Pillars of Sustainable POA&M Programs

| Pillar | What It Looks Like |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Policy Integration** | POA&M requirements are written into org-wide policy |
| **Standardization** | Everyone uses the same format, fields, and naming conventions |
| **Automation** | Due dates, severity scoring, and status tracking are built-in |
| **Visibility** | Dashboards and metrics show executive-level performance |
| **Accountability** | Owners are defined, trained, and monitored |
| **Continuous Improvement** | POA&Ms are reviewed for patterns, delays, and systemic fixes |

---

## 📊 Critical Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| % of POA&Ms Closed on Time | Measures program discipline |
| Average Days to Closure | Reflects responsiveness |
| Repeat Findings | Exposes deeper process weaknesses |
| Aging/Open > 90 Days | Audit red flag |
| POA&Ms by Team/System | Helps prioritize risk mitigation focus |

Use your POA&M template or GRC tool to gather and report these regularly.

## 📈 Maturity Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Ad Hoc** | POA&Ms tracked inconsistently in spreadsheets |
| **Basic** | Basic tracking, no metrics |
| **Repeatable** | Consistent formatting and updates |
| **Managed** | Dashboard visibility, process owners, reviews |
| **Optimized** | Fully automated, integrated, and audit-ready at all times |

Where can you help it go next?
