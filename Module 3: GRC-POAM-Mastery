#  Module 3: Managing & Executing POA&Ms  
**POA&M Mastery – Risk Management & Compliance Execution**

---

## 🎯 Module Purpose

This module explores how POA&Ms are managed and executed over time. While I haven’t yet managed POA&Ms in a formal role, I’ve studied the real-world workflow and used hands-on practice to simulate how security and compliance teams handle POA&Ms from creation to closure.

>  *My goal is to understand not just how POA&Ms are written — but how they’re driven to completion.*

##  The POA&M Lifecycle I’ve Studied

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Discovery** | Control gaps found via audit, vulnerability scan, or assessment |
| **Creation** | Drafting the POA&M entry with fields like risk, source, due date |
| **Assignment** | Assigning ownership and identifying responsible teams |
| **Remediation Planning** | Creating milestone steps and remediation plans |
| **Tracking & Updates** | Updating status and delays throughout the lifecycle |
| **Closure & Evidence** | Uploading documentation to validate remediation for audit

## ✍️ My Learning Experience

I’ve spent time:
- Reviewing how POA&Ms fit into the **NIST RMF** process (especially the *Assess* and *Monitor* steps)  
- Practicing POA&M entry updates using mock vulnerability data  
- Simulating POA&M reviews and closure reporting using Excel and milestone tracking  
- Studying metrics that mature GRC teams use to monitor POA&M effectiveness

I created this module to better understand how organizations drive action through POA&M reviews, dashboards, and escalations — especially when deadlines slip.

## 📊 Practice Example I Worked Through

Using the sample file `Mock WSUS ACAS SCAN.xlsx`, I identified a mock finding:

| Field | Sample Entry |
|-------|--------------|
| Weakness ID | WSUS-2024-001 |
| Description | CVE-2023-XXXX on SQL Server 2019 |
| Source | WSUS Vulnerability Scan |
| Severity | High |
| Scheduled Completion Date | 2024-09-01 |
| Milestones | 1. Patch by 08/15, 2. Validate by 08/25 |
| Status | Open |
| Evidence | To be attached post-remediation |

This helped me visualize how GRC teams work across technical and compliance teams to close risks systematically.

##  Reflection Prompt

> ✅ *What makes a POA&M more than a task list?*

Answer: Ownership, communication, evidence, and follow-through.

## 🏁 Summary

- I created this module to simulate the process of managing open POA&Ms from discovery to closure  
- While I haven’t done this in a professional role yet, I’ve built my confidence through guided practice  
- This training prepares me to contribute meaningfully to a GRC or compliance team when the opportunity arises
